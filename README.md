This page was inspired from a post I saw on daily.dev and dev.to.

I seen many posts of people who was sharing top command line commands and the idea just came me.

I am learning to use Linux and also todo more by using the command line on both my windows and linux machines.

I used HTML, Tailwind CSS and JSON to create this page. 

I also had some assistance from ChatGPT to help explain some things to me and helped to debug some issues.
